# AI2-THOR_Navigation
A program to navigate the virtual agent in AI2-THOR library. It can be controlled with simple commands to move around and interact with objects in the environment.
This is a part of my 2022 Summer Robotics and Autonomous System REU at University of Southern California.
With the help of my mentor: Dr. Jesse Thomason from GLAMOR lab.
